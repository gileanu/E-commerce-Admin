# :zap: E-commerce Admin

Full stack E-commerce Admin dashboard built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma and PostgreSQL.

Currently the project is finished, works and I'm looking forward to adding more features, small optimizations.

The source code of this project is not mine, I took inspiration from watching this incredible YouTube tutorial from [@AntonioErdeljac](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac) : [Full Stack E-Commerce + Dashboard & CMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5miHyP6lExg). But I did not just followed the tutorial, I set myself up with 2 challenges: No copy&paste any code, from the tutorial or from other sources, meaning that the this repository contains only code written by me. And if there were any issues, stuff not working, all debugging (lots of) was done by me.

_Note: This tutorial being a few months old, there were a couple of things that I had to make work with the current versions of Next.js and other dependencies used to develop this project._

## Stack:

- Next.js 14.1 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma

## UI:

- shadcn/ui

## Auth:

- [Clerk](https://clerk.com)

## Content Management System:

- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)

_Note: Later versions of this project will use built-in Auth it's own CMS._

## Payments:

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
